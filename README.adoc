Based on the data from https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/data[Kaggle], this repository will hold all models, thoughts questions and code as we explore this data set on a weekly basis.

Each week on the https://twitch.tv/neo4j_[Neo4j Twitch channel], we will build out on this data set, exploring together different questions we might to ask. After each session, I will update this repository with what has been covered during the session.

=== Week 0: Loading the data

I have taken the liberty of downloading and unzipping the data set, ready for import using https://neo4j.com/developer/kb/import-csv-locations/[`LOAD CSV`].
----
//return the first row from the wine data
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM `https://github.com/lju-lazarevic/importdata/blob/master/winemag-data-130k-v2.csv?raw=true` AS row
RETURN row LIMIT 1
----

=== Week 1: Modelling the data

We will figure out the initial model during the https://twitch.tv/neo4j_[Twitch] session. You may find having a sheet of paper, or http://www.apcjones.com/arrows/#[Arrows] handy!
