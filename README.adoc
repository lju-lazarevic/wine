Based on the data from https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/data[Kaggle], this repository will hold all models, thoughts, questions and code as we explore this data set on a weekly basis.

Follow along on the https://twitch.tv/neo4j_[Neo4j Twitch channel]!


[#week1]
=== Week 1 (18 May): Let's explore the data!
_Want to participate?_

* _http://www.apcjones.com/arrows/#[Link to Arrows for data modelling^]_
* _https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews/data[Link to the original data set^]_

So this was an exciting start to the week! Having only just found the wine data set not that much before the start of the Twitch session, it certainly was a voyage of discovery. In this session we:

* Had a look at the data set, thinking about some of the questions we might ask and insight we could discover
* Had an initial think about what might the data model look like, and some of the modelling decisions we're going to have to make over the coming weeks
* Decided upon pairing down the data set for now, and start thinking about importing that data

*Exploring the data*

First of all, let's take a sample peak at the data:

We'll probably find having a definition of the headers helpful for some of the less obvious fields!

[cols="1,4",width="75%"]
|===
|Header | Description

|<id>
|The row id of the data set

|country 
|The country that the wine is from

|description 
|Description used to describe the tasting features of the wine

|designation 
|The vineyard within the winery where the grapes that made the wine are from. A winery may have more than one vineyard

|points

|price 
|The cost for a bottle of the wine

|province 
|The province or state that the wine is from

|region_1 
|The wine growing area in a province or state (ie Napa Valley)

|region_2 
|Sometimes there are more specific regions specified within a wine growing area (ie Rutherford inside the Napa Valley)

|taster_name 
|Name of the taster

|taster_twitter_handle 
|Taster's twitter handle

|title 
|The title of the wine review, which often contains the vintage if you're interested in extracting that feature

|variety 
|The type of grapes used to make the wine (ie Pinot Noir)

|winery 
|The winery that made the wine
|===

A very interesting data set indeed. There are some rather cool things that we can explore, such as:

* Do tasters stick to certain wines, or do they go across different grape varieties/countries?
* How do points compare to price?
* How do varities cross countries?
* We can tokenise the description - can we recommend wines based on description elements?
* ...and so many more!

*Data set challenges*

As we explored this data, a number of questions arose: 

* Could we safely make the assumption that each line represented a unique wine? Or were we looking at a wine with multiple entries becauses different reviewers reviewed it?
* Were there data duplications?
* What's the year of the wine?
* and so forth

We decided to have a quick look at the data using MS Excel. We discovered some things about the data:

* there is only one wine per reviewer, so we're not dealing with multiple reviews per wine
* there are indeed duplications in the wine, we need to resolve those
* we are going to need to do some work on the wine name - we'll need to extract the year, and also we'll want to keep the title as a wine can be across many years

As an outcome of the session, I will revise the data and removed the duplicates in the dataset. Note that we could have done this within Neo4j, but I am always a fan of cleaning the data prior to a load if it is straightforward to do so!

*Modelling*

We then turned our thoughts to modelling. Using http://www.apcjones.com/arrows[Arrows^], we took a first pass at taking all of the data elements available, and then assigning them as either node labels, relationship types, or properties on either. The first pass looked like this:

.The initial pass - getting the data down on paper!
image::img\model1.jpg[]

Whilst this is far from the finished article, this initial pass allows us to start thinking about what questions we were looking to answer, and based on that, how would we change this model. There will be other things we'll need to think about resolving too, such as:

* How are we going to manage `Province` -> `Region1` -> `Region2`? Not all wines have all those details
* How are we going to represent `Wine` (of which the title contains name wine + year), and then the `WineTitle` and it's respective `Year`?
* We've also got `Designation` to add! Where's that going?

We will visit all of these questions, and more, as we continue our wine adventure!

*Importing the data*

For now, we've got a cut-down model we're going to import (we'll import the rest in the next session!), which is the following

.Model based on partial data - slightly less contravertial!
image::img\model2.jpg[]

Based on the approaches we use below, we are dealing with some of the duplicate values for now.

*Setting indexes*

As we would expect `Winery` and `Country` to be unique names, we are going to be setting some indexes to allow use to `MERGE` as we load the new data. `MERGE` behaves like a `CREATE` if the data doesn't already exist, and a `MATCH` if it does. You can read more about `MERGE` in https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/merge/[the documentation^].

For now, we're going to assume that `Province` is also unique, and we'll set an index on a property for that too. Not the end of the world we've we're wrong - we'll just correct the data later. All part of the journey.

I suggest you enable https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-browser/#browser-tips[multi statement query editor^] in browser as we start to do multiple queries in a row!

To set the indexes, run the following in Neo4j Browser:

----
CREATE INDEX ON :Winery(name);
CREATE INDEX ON :Province(name);
CREATE INDEX ON :Country(name);
----

*Dealing with null values*

So we discovered some null values in our data! We have some decisions to make. Do we want to skip values if they have a null, or do we want to set a default value? For the purposes of Country, Province and Winery, we are going to want to set some sort of value. Either we can later on extrapolate the information and correct it, or we are getting useful information by knowing it does not exist. So for this scenario we are going to stick with 'No Country', 'No Province' and 'No Winery' as our default options.

There are a number of ways we can deal with null values, and in this instance, I'm going to use the `FOREACH - IN CASE WHEN` trick. We are going to be combining `FOREACH` to allow us to do a `MERGE`, and `CASE` to check for nulls and set a default. I'm still looking for any content talking about this trick, and I'll update this document when I find it!

Loading the nodes and relationships can be memory hungry, so I am going to load the data in two passes. First of all, let's load all the nodes:
----
:auto //add this line if you're using Neo4j Browser
USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'https://github.com/lju-lazarevic/importdata/blob/master/winemag-data-130k-v3.csv?raw=true' AS row
FOREACH (i IN 
    CASE WHEN row.country IS NOT NULL 
         THEN [row.country] 
         ELSE ["No Country"] 
    END | MERGE (c:Country {name:i}))
FOREACH (i IN 
    CASE WHEN row.province IS NOT NULL 
         THEN [row.province] 
         ELSE ["No Province"] 
    END | MERGE (p:Province {name:i}))
FOREACH (i IN 
    CASE WHEN row.winery IS NOT NULL 
         THEN [row.winery] 
         ELSE ["No Winery"] 
    END | MERGE (w:Winery {name:i}))
----

Now we need to add the relationships between country, province and winery. I'm sure there's a prettier way to do this, which I will update when I think of it! For now, we also need to think about those null values again when we're doing the second pass:
----
:auto //add this line if you're using Neo4j Browser
USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
//:auto
//USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'https://github.com/lju-lazarevic/importdata/blob/master/winemag-data-130k-v3.csv?raw=true' AS row
WITH 
    CASE row.country 
        WHEN null 
        THEN "No Country" 
        ELSE row.country 
    END AS country,
    CASE row.province 
        WHEN null 
        THEN "No Province" 
        ELSE row.province 
    END AS province, 
    CASE row.winery 
        WHEN null 
        THEN "No Winery" 
        ELSE row.winery 
    END AS winery
MATCH (c:Country {name:country}), 
    (p:Province {name:province}), 
    (w:Winery {name:winery})
MERGE (w)-[:FROM_PROVENCE]->(p)
WITH p,c
MERGE (p)-[:PROVINCE_COUNTRY]->(c)
----

And that's the data in! As we've been using `MERGE`, that will take care of any duplicate values, so we don't need to worry about those.

*What next?*

Phew! So we've got some data in. I'll leave it to you, dear reader, to think what questions you might ask of the data. I'll suggest the following to get you started, and we'll cover them in the next session:

* Which countries have the most wineries?
* Are there any wineries across different countries?
* Which wineries are across multiple provinces?

I would love to hear what interesting discoveries you have also found. Let me know during the session!

See you on the 1st June!

Can't make the session? Not to worry, the recording will be on the https://youtube.com/neo4j[Neo4j YouTube channel^] soon after.

This week was an interesting installment! We spent the first part of the session walking through the rationale behind the load queries for the data. As you may recall we had some duplicates to deal with, so we made some decisions, such as assuming that all wineries and provinces has unique names, and we imported the data.

I also posed some questions to you all to ask of this data, as a reminder, the questions were:

* Which countries have the most wineries?
* Are there any wineries across different countries?
* Which wineries are across multiple provinces?

As well as using Cypher to answer the questions, we also had a brief look at the data using Neo4j Bloom. For those of you who have not come across Bloom before, it's a near natural language visualisation tool for graphs. You can read more about it https://medium.com/neo4j/bloom-ing-marvellous-a2be0c3702bb[here^].

So, onto those queries!

.Which countries have the most wineries?
----
MATCH path=(w:Winery)-[:FROM_PROVENCE]->(p:Province)-[:PROVINCE_COUNTRY]->(c:Country)
RETURN c.name AS Country, count(DISTINCT w) AS Total 
ORDER BY Total DESC
----

.Which wineries are across multiple provinces?
----
MATCH (w:Winery)-[:FROM_PROVENCE]->(p:Province)
WITH w, COLLECT(p.name) AS Provinces, count(p) AS Total
RETURN w.name AS Winery, Provinces, Total 
ORDER BY Total DESC
----

So, having had a look at that data, we then decided to add more data. Again, we're going to leave the sticky matter of how to deal with regions for now. We decided we'd add `Taster`, `Designation` and `Variety`, as well as the `Wine` itself. If you recall, `Wine` name also contained the year - and we'll probably want to extract that. But for now, we'll import it as is.

.The expanded data model that now includes Designation, Taster, Wine and Variety
image::img\model3.jpg[]

First of all, we need to set some indexes. We do this because this will allow us to search for data faster by using an index look up on properties of interest rather than doing a full database scan. It's also super helpful if we're using `MERGE`, again for the same reason.

.Set the required indexes
----
//indexes for additional data
CREATE INDEX ON :Wine(id);
CREATE INDEX ON :Taster(name);
CREATE INDEX ON :Variety(name);
CREATE INDEX ON :Designation(name);
----

And now we can load the data. As before, we will do two passes of this, one to create the nodes, and then the second pass to create the relationships. You will notice in the second pass we also search for the `Winery` node - this is so that we can connect it up to `Wine`!

.Loading the `Designation`, `Taster`, `Variety` and `Wine` nodes. Note that we use `CREATE` for `Wine` - that's because we expect all instances to be unique, so we can just create them
----
:auto //add this line if you're using Neo4j Browser
USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'https://github.com/lju-lazarevic/importdata/blob/master/winemag-data-130k-v3.csv?raw=true' AS row
FOREACH (i IN
    CASE WHEN row.designation IS NOT NULL
         THEN [row.designation]
         ELSE ["No Designation"]
    END | MERGE (d:Designation {name:i}))
FOREACH (i IN
    CASE WHEN row.taster_name IS NOT NULL
         THEN [row.taster_name]
         ELSE ["No Taster"]
    END | MERGE (t:Taster {name:i}))
FOREACH (i IN
    CASE WHEN row.variety IS NOT NULL
         THEN [row.variety]
         ELSE ["No Variety"]
    END | MERGE (v:Variety {name:i}))
CREATE (w:Wine {id:row.id, title:row.title})
----

.And following up with creating the relationships. You will notice all of the relationship types are `CREATE`, this is because they all join onto `Wine`, which as we said previously, we assume to be unique for all entries.
----
:auto //add this line if you're using Neo4j Browser
USING PERIODIC COMMIT 1000
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'https://github.com/lju-lazarevic/importdata/blob/master/winemag-data-130k-v3.csv?raw=true' AS row
WITH
    CASE row.designation
        WHEN null
        THEN "No Designation"
        ELSE row.designation
    END AS designation,
    CASE row.taster_name 
        WHEN null
        THEN "No Taster"
        ELSE row.taster_name 
    END AS taster,
    CASE row.variety
        WHEN null
        THEN "No Variety"
        ELSE row.variety
    END AS variety,
    CASE row.winery
        WHEN null
        THEN "No Winery"
        ELSE row.winery
    END AS winery,
    row.id as id
MATCH (d:Designation {name:designation}),
    (t:Taster {name:taster}),
    (v:Variety {name:variety}),
    (w:Wine {id:id}),
    (win:Winery {name:winery})
CREATE (w)-[:FROM_WINERY]->(win)
CREATE (w)-[:HAS_VARIETY]->(v)
CREATE (t)-[:RATES_WINE]->(w)
CREATE (w)-[:HAS_DESIGNATION]->(d)
----

Excellent! So we've got that data in, and now we can think about some different questions we can ask. For example:

* Who is the most prolific wine taster?
* How many wine varieties contain the word 'red'?

.Querying for the most prolific wine taster
----
//Most prolific taster
MATCH (t:Taster)
WHERE t.name <> "No Taster"
WITH t
MATCH (t)-[:RATES_WINE]->(w:Wine)-[:HAS_VARIETY]->(v:Variety)
WITH t, count(w) AS total, COLLECT(DISTINCT v.name) AS varieties
RETURN t.name AS taster, varieties, total 
ORDER BY total DESC
----

.Finding all the varieties that contain the word 'red' in them
----
MATCH (v:Variety)
WHERE tolower(v.name) CONTAINS 'red'
RETURN v.name 
ORDER BY v.name
----

Have a go at some other questions yourself! You can always use Bloom to help think about what you might want to investigate too. If you can think of a question that you're not sure how to write a query for, we can cover it in the session.

=== Week 3 (6 June - 9am PDT, 12pm EDT, 5pm BST, 6pm CEST): Let's tackle those wine years!

* _Complete the steps for Week 1 & 2 to load the data_

Well... this was a slightly painful week! We all have bad days and I guess it was my turn :). Nevertheless, there is some very good learning to be had, and hopefully you'll be equiped that little bit better to spot issues.

Let's start off with a top tip for this week...

[TIP]
Do you have a smallish dataset? Is it taking a very long time to `MERGE` your data? Check if you have correctly set your indexes! More on that shortly <blush>.

So, what we were aiming to do this week:

* Refactor the model yet again to think how we'll show years and titles. The big difference here being we're not importing data, we're working with data that we already have in the database
* Pull the years out of the wine titles and create separate `Year` and `WineTitle` nodes
* Ask some questions!

So, let's get going!

*Yet another model revision*

We started of with trying to decide how would we go about modelling the relationship between:

* Wine Group (the term we decided to refer to a wine's title but without the year)
* Year
* Wine (which has a title that contains wine group and year)

For the puroses of just getting something to work with, we ended up with a sketch of the following to walk through the rationale:

.A worked example of how the physical data might connect
image::img\model4.jpg[]

We don't expect there to be many relationships coming off of `WineGroup` - there'll probably be a few years and that's it. The more tricky one may well be `WineGroup` to `Year` - `Year` could quite possibly become a dense node. Not all dense nodes are bad - if you're not traversing between multiple dense nodes it might be fine. For now, let's leave it as it is, and we can always refactor the model to deal with it if necessary later.

So, based on this, let's have a look at what our data model now stands:

.An update...
image::img\model5.jpg[]

It didn't feel quite right, so I decided that `Year` should come off `Wine` and not `WineGroup`:

.The latest iteration of the wine data model
image::img\model6.jpg[]

I'm still not crazy about this model, but that's completely fine. That's one of the things that I love about graph databases - we don't have to get the data model perfect, we just get something that's in the right direction, and we just iterate and refine it as we go along and understand our data better. Undoubtedly we'll be back soon enough with some changes.

*I'm coming for you, wine year and group!*

Ok, now with that out of the way, we are going to extract that year, and a title without the year for our two new nodes, `Year` and `WineGroup`. We could have dealt with this before importing the data, but I thought it would be a good opportunity to use APOC to help us make changes with what we already have, in the database. 

Due to how the wine title is structured, we are going to be using some fancy regex patterns to get the job done. We'll also be using the text helper function apoc.text.replace(). Let's look at some examples.

_Getting the yearless wine group_

This is the easy bit - we want to find 4 digits next to each other, and then replace them with nothing. Just pulling a few to look at as an example, if we run the following:

----
MATCH (w:Wine) 
RETURN w.title, apoc.text.replace(w.title, '([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])', '') AS test LIMIT 5
----

We get:

image::img\img1.jpg[width="600"]

Brilliant! Turns out getting the year is a teeny bit more involved with it comes to regex... Undoubtedly there'll be a better way to do this, but I'm glad I've got something at all:

----
MATCH (w:Wine) 
RETURN w.title, apoc.text.replace(w.title, '[^0-9]|[^0-9][0-9]{1,3}[^0-9]|^[0-9]{1,3}[^0-9]|[^0-9][0-9]{1,3}$', '') AS test LIMIT 5
----

Woah! Yes... ok, taking each option (separated with `|`), we have:

* Is not a digit
* Is not a digit, followed by a digit that repeats up to 3 times followed by not a digit
* Starts with a number that repeats up to 3 times followed by not a digit
* Not a digit, followed with a number that repeats up to 3 times at the end

I would love to hear input on how to make that pattern more elegant! Let's have a look at a sample:

image::img\img2.jpg[width="600"]

Success! We can extract both the year and wine groups - now let's convert them into nodes, and hook everything up according to our model. To do that, let's use another APOC tool to help, the procedue apoc.periodic.iterate().

First of all, let's set those all important indexes:

----
CREATE INDEX ON :WineGroup(title);
CREATE INDEX ON :Year(value);
----

So - some of you who were watching me last week may have noticed I was just not getting any joy when trying to create the `WineGroup` node... in the end it took over an hour(!!!) to finish - I stopped the video when it was taking minutes and just left it. I only just spotted the shocking mistake I had made when I came to do the write up... I had created an index for `:WineGroup(title)`, but I was trying to create a node of `:WineTitle(title)`. Ouch. Rerunning the whole thing again (with the indexes/right label names), reader I can assure you it only took a mere 4s. So, as for our impromptu tip of the day - if it's a small data set and it's taking a long time, check your indexes.

That aside, let's get to the business of the day, updating the data. As before, we'll go in 3 passes, the two different node labels, and then join them with the relationships:

----
//Create the WineGroup nodes
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
  "MATCH (w:Wine) RETURN apoc.text.replace(w.title, '([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])', '') AS wineTitle",
  "MERGE (g:WineGroup{title:wineTitle})",
  {batchSize:100, parallel:false})
----

----
//Create the Year nodes
CALL apoc.periodic.iterate(
  "MATCH (w:Wine) RETURN apoc.text.replace(w.title, '[^0-9]|[^0-9][0-9]{1,3}[^0-9]|^[0-9]{1,3}[^0-9]|[^0-9][0-9]{1,3}$', '') AS year",
  "MERGE (y:Year{value:year})",
  {batchSize:100, parallel:false})
----

----
//join it all together
MATCH (w:Wine) 
WITH apoc.text.replace(w.title, '([0-9][0-9][0-9][0-9])', '') AS wineTitle, 
     apoc.text.replace(w.title, '[^0-9]|[^0-9][0-9]{1,3}[^0-9]|^[0-9]{1,3}[^0-9]|[^0-9][0-9]{1,3}$', '') AS year, w
MATCH (y:Year {value:year}), (wg:WineGroup{title:wineTitle})
CREATE (w)-[:FROM_YEAR]->(y), 
       (w)-[:IN_WINE_GROUP]->(wg)
----

But uh oh.... we have a problem... Looking at the years we have, we get the following:

image::img\img3.jpg[width="600"]

and

image::img\img4.jpg[width="600"]

Not to worry, let's get that fixed next :).

[#week4]
=== Week 4 (13 June - 9am PDT, 12pm EDT, 5pm BST, 6pm CEST): Oh no! We have a year problem!

A quick entry for this week, and I'll expand accordingly later.

So it turns out the regex didn't quite work as expected from last week. So in this week's session we did a bit of digging.

Regex didn't work so well - we were also catching 2 digits, we fixed the regex for that with the following:

----
MATCH (w:Wine) WHERE w.title contains("1000")
RETURN w.title, 
     apoc.text.replace(w.title, '( [2][0-1][0-1][0-9])', '') AS test1,
     apoc.text.replace(w.title, '( [1][9][7-9][0-9])', '') AS test2 
LIMIT 5
----

It's not pretty, but it does the job, and I'll take it!

However, that aside we still have some other challenges. For example:

* Some wines have 'weird' years - branding years
* Some wines have 2 years, the branding year and the actual wine year
* Some wines have no years!

We interrogated the data, and decided one of the sensible ways to tackle this would be the following:

* Assume year range of 1970-2017 - any wine with a year that doesn't fall within this range we will assume is a branding year
* Wines with a branding year or no year, we'll tag with 'No Year', like we have done for other labels
* If a wine has two years, go for the one that sits in the above range
* If a wine has two years of which both sit in the above range, go for the highest

Whilst it may involve some creative querying to enforce the above rules, the fact that we have them will be a huge help, irrespective of what approach we use to resolve this particular challenge.

Before we continue, we should clear up the wine years and groups. We can do that with the following code snippets:

----
//Remove the year nodes
MATCH (y:Year)
DETACH
DELETE y;
----

----
//Remove the wine group nodes
MATCH (wg:WineGroup)
DETACH
DELETE wg;
----

One more attempt... and then we'll move onto the next part of the journey

Last attempt of trying to sort out the year and wine groups before I turn to alternative means so that we can move on!
